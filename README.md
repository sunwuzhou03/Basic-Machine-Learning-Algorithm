# Basic-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
Use python with numpy, pandas and so on to implement the basic machine learning algorithm. 

# Machine learning algorithms that have been implemented

1. Adaboost

2. Kmeans

3. Liner Regression

4. Logistic Regression and OVR version. 

5. Naive Bayes classifier

6. Neural Network

7. Random Forest

8. Support vector machine and OVR version.


# Notice

You can find the algorithm version in the Machine Learning Course Design 1. This file is used to compare the different classification algorithm.

The Machine Learning Course Design 1 is a project that how to use pytorch to solve the Handwritten digit recognition.
